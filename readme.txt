This magical piece of markup monkery will make your mission to muster magnificent missives on your monitor much more manageable.

== Description ==

"You know, for grids." #obscurefilmreferences

This plugin allows you to overlay a 12 or 16 column fluid grid to check your positioning when developing fluid or responsive sites.

It also assists you by overlaying lines based on your theme's line height so that you can correctly set your vertical rhythm and line up all of your typography to a baseline grid like the titan of typography that I'm certain you are. 

One should be aware that this is a plugin primarily promoted to pixel pushers and isn't for production use. You would do well to know quite a bit about CSS and you should know how your theme is laid out in the HTMLs before using this plugin. 

Much to my deep sorrow, it is but a certainty that this fine piece of positional plugin prowess won't work with IE 8 and below (but, surely, one would not be so foolish as to create sites using IE as a development browser) as it requires the magnificent `background-size: 100%` CSS3 property to be present. Which in IE, to my great distress, it's not.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'line-in-typography' folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to `Settings -> Line In Typography` and edit your settings (you'll need to know which elements you want to apply the grid to)
1. As if by magic, a control panel should appear on the user side where you should be able to toggle the various options.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this make my theme have amazing typography? =

Oh my dear fellow, good grief no. A computer? Automatically setting type? Mr Gutenberg would be aghast at such a thought!

Fear not though, friend, for I have a solution for you! The Inter Web Network!

I would advise a thorough study of [this article](http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm) on composing to a vertical rhythm. 

Don't worry, old chap, it took me a good long while to make sense of this obfuscated balderdash too. Should I ever be blessed with a moment, it would cheer me no end to publish some articles about this very topic (maybe with some LESS mixins) over on my [web design blog](http://line-in.co.uk/blog). 

== Screenshots ==

1. The lines activated, with the test paragraph at the top and the control panel displayed.
1. Grids activated with the control panel hidden. Notice that the grids override the current background on the elements that they're applied to so they're not hidden.
